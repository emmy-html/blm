# Protect Black Lives
## A collection of resources in the interest of protecting all Black lives.

**Protect Black Lives** was created in the interest of protecting all Black lives, in direct response to the world's
protesting of George Floyd's tragic murder. This project has no affiliation with any existing organizations, and was created by an [individual](https://github.com/emmy-html) hoping to spread awareness and education on the effects of systemic racism and how we can enact change.
